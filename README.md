# üëã Hi there

## ‚ùî About

I‚Äôm a developer who has been gradually learning lower level technologies; starting with python and web dev, creating a wayland compositor and algebraic calculater, and currently working on compilers and optimizing backends. I'm eager to contribute to existing open source projects, but also happily create new open source projects if, in my opinion, the existing ones don't fit what I want. My success is in part thanks to linux, as it always allowed me to go down 1 layer of abstraction which lead me to create some of the projects that I learned the most from including my wayland compositor, programming language, and optimizing backend.

## üì´ How to reach me...

You can contact me on [email](mailto:r2hk9ahnf@relay.firefox.com).

## üì∞ Whats happaning

### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on...

A programming language called common assembly. Check it out [here](https://github.com/godalming123/common-assembly).

### ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on...

I've made several PR's while on github including (in order from newest to oldest):
